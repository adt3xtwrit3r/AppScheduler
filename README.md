# AppScheduler

I have used Kotlin and MVVM architectural design pattern, I have also used Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection and Room Database for local storage.
For Navigation I have used the android navigation component. I have used Alarm Manager and Broadcast Receiver to schedule an app launch.

Users can schedule an app launch at a given time which will be stored in local storage (ROOM). 
Users can update or delete a scheduled app launch before or after a successful app launch.

Successful launch Logs can be stored in local storage and time conflict can be solved also.
