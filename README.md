# AppScheduler

I have used kotlin and MVVM architectural design pattern, I have also used Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection and Room Database for local storage.
For Navigation I have used android navigation component. I have used Alarm Manager and Broadcast Receiver to schedule an app launch.

User can schedule an app launch in given time which will be stored in local storage (ROOM). 
User can update or delete a scheduled app launch before or after succesful app launch.

Successful launch Logs can be stored in local stoarage and time conflict can be solved also. I will share that knowledge if I am called for the next stage
of the interview process.
